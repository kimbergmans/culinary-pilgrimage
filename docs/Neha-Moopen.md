You have to get the Mysore Masala Dosa. The South Indian Thali is also nice to try.

## Waarom geef ik je deze tip {-}

If I have to describe a dosa, I guess I would say it's like a savory crepe. It's usually served with some chutneys and a lentil-based curry called sambar. Dosa is a very popular food in South India, where I'm from. There are so many varieties of dosa, the menu at restaurants like Saravanaa Bhavan can have 20 to 50 types (I don't know the actual number, but there's just a lot). A masala dosa comes with a potato filling and the Mysore Masala Dosa is a way more delicious version of it. I've introduced several friends and colleagues in the Netherlands to this dish and they've all enjoyed it, I really hope you will like too! Saravanaa Bhavan is one of the few authentic South Indian restaurants in the Netherlands (as far as I know). It's a huge and famous restaurant chain with branches in India and around the world - everybody goes there. My mum says it's not as perfect as it is in India, but I'm not as discerning and I always like it!
